# Trust Fund Management Smart Contract

This repository contains a smart contract written in Solidity for managing trust funds and controlling information systems. The contract utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (zkp) to prove login authenticity and provides document storage functionality.

## Features

1. User Registration: Users can register with a unique username and password.
2. User Login: Registered users can log in by providing their username and password, which is authenticated using zero-knowledge proofs.
3. User Logout: Logged-in users can log out from the system.
4. Document Storage: Logged-in users can store their documents securely.
5. Document Retrieval: Logged-in users can retrieve their stored documents.

## Contract Structure

The smart contract consists of the following major components:

- **User Struct**: A structure that stores user information including username, password, and login status.
- **Users Mapping**: A mapping that associates user addresses with their respective User structs.
- **Documents Mapping**: A mapping that associates user addresses with their stored documents.
- **Event**: An event that is emitted when a user successfully logs in.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hajihashemabad/TrustFundManagement.git
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (Solidity compiler, Ethereum development framework, Python zkp library, etc.) as per your environment and project requirements.

3. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.

4. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using your preferred development framework (Truffle, Remix, etc.) or interact with it via a client library (Web3.js, ethers.js, etc.).
5. Implement the `verifyProof` function in the smart contract, using a Python zkp library (e.g., ZoKrates), to verify the zero-knowledge proof. Replace the placeholder implementation with the actual logic for verifying the proof.
6. Update the contract with the actual zero-knowledge proof verification logic in the `verifyProof` function.
7. Test the contract by registering users, logging in, storing documents, and retrieving documents.

## Usage

The following functions are available in the smart contract:

- `registerUser(string username, string password)`: Allows users to register with a unique username and password.
- `login(string username, string password)`: Enables registered users to log in by providing their username and password.
- `logout()`: Allows logged-in users to log out from the system.
- `storeDocument(string document)`: Enables logged-in users to securely store their documents.
- `retrieveDocument()`: Allows logged-in users to retrieve their stored documents.
